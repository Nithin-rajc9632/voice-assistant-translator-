# voice-assistant-translator-
This HTML project creates a voice command and translation web app using the Web Speech API, allowing users to speak in English and receive real-time word-by-word translations into selected Indian languages such as Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, or Hindi. The app displays the recognized text, translates it, and can speak the translated sentence.
